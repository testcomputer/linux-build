When managing or troubleshooting networks in a Linux environment, there are several key commands and configurations you might want to look for. Here’s a comprehensive list:
Network Commands

    ifconfig: Display or configure network interfaces. (Note: It's deprecated in favor of ip but still widely used).

    ip: A versatile tool for network configuration. It can replace several old commands like ifconfig, route, arp, etc.

    iwconfig: Configure wireless network interfaces.

    ping: Test connectivity between your machine and another.

    traceroute: Show the route packets take to a network host.

    netstat: Display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

    ss: Another utility to investigate sockets. It’s used to dump socket statistics and can replace netstat.

    tcpdump: A powerful command-line packet analyzer.

    nmap: Network exploration tool and security/port scanner.

    dig: DNS lookup utility.

    nslookup: Another tool for querying the DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.

    route: Show/manipulate the IP routing table. (Note: Mostly replaced by ip route).

    arp: View or manipulate the system's ARP cache.

    ethtool: Display or change Ethernet device settings.

    host: Simple utility for performing DNS lookups.

    nmcli: Command-line tool for controlling NetworkManager.

    iwlist: Display more detailed information from wireless network interfaces.

    dhclient: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client – used to obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.

    iptables: Administration tool for IPv4 packet filtering and NAT.

    ip6tables: Similar to iptables but for IPv6.

    nc (netcat): Networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections.

    curl: Tool to transfer data from or to a server.

    wget: Non-interactive network downloader.

    mtr: Combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping programs.

    lsof -i: List open files and their corresponding network connections.

Configuration Files to Check

    /etc/network/interfaces: The main network configuration file for Debian-based systems.

    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-*: Network configuration scripts for each interface on RHEL/CentOS.

    /etc/resolv.conf: Resolver configuration file, specifies the DNS servers.

    /etc/hosts: Local static table lookup for hostnames.

    /etc/nsswitch.conf: Config file for Name Service Switch, decides the order of hostname lookup.

    /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf: Configuration for the DHCP client.

    /etc/netplan/*.yaml: Configuration files for Netplan (common in recent Ubuntu versions).

    /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf: Configuration for WPA Supplicant, used in securing wireless networks.

    /proc/net/dev: File displaying network adapter and statistics.

    /etc/sysconfig/network: Main network configuration file on RHEL/CentOS.

    /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf: Configuration for NetworkManager.

This list should cover most of the essentials for network management and troubleshooting on Linux. Remember that the availability and exact functionality of these commands can vary slightly between different Linux distributions.
