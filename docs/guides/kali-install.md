## Installing Kali Linux

### 1. Download the Kali Linux ISO
- Visit the official Kali Linux [downloads page](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
- Choose the appropriate version for your system (e.g., 64-bit, 32-bit, ARM, etc.).
- Click on the download link to start downloading the ISO file.

### 2. Create a Bootable USB Drive
- Insert a USB drive into your computer.
- Use a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (for Windows) or `dd` command (for Linux) to create a bootable USB drive using the downloaded ISO.

### 3. Boot from the USB Drive
- Restart your computer.
- Access the boot menu (usually by pressing F12, F2, or ESC, depending on your system).
- Choose to boot from the USB drive.

### 4. Start the Installation
- Once Kali Linux loads, select "Graphical Install" or "Install" from the menu.
- Follow the on-screen instructions, selecting your language, location, and keyboard layout.
- Set up your network and hostname.
- Create a user and set a password.
- Partition your disk as required.
- Continue with the installation process. Once completed, the system will prompt you to remove the installation media and press ENTER.

### 5. Reboot and Login
